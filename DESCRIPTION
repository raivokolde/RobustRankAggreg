Description: Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of
    genes. It implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in
    preparation) and some other simple algorithms for the task. RRA
    method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that is robust to
    noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance
    probabilities for all the elements in the final ranking.
