\title{Calculate beta scores}
\usage{
  betaScores(r)
}
\arguments{
  \item{r}{vector of values in [0, 1]}
}
\value{
  The functions returns a vector of p-values, that
  correspond to the sorted input vector. The NA-s are
  pushed to the end.
}
\description{
  Calculate the beta scores for normalized rank vector.
}
\details{
  Takes in a vector with values in [0, 1]. It sorts the
  values to get the order statistics and calculates
  p-values for each of the order statistics. These are
  based on their expected distribution under the null
  hypothesis of uniform distribution.

  In RRA algorithm context the inputs are supposed to be
  normalized ranks. However, p-values in general follow the
  uniform distribution, therefore it can be used with any
  kind of p-value vectors, to see if there are more small
  values than expected.

  The NA values are removed before calculation and all
  results take into account only existing values.
